ContactsApplicationAndroid is a school project ðŸŽ“

We had to build a contact management application. Edit a contact, delete, add to favorites, display only favorites, share the contact, send an SMS, an email, share this contact, scan a QR Code to add a contact or create a QR Code to share one of our contacts.
